# Recombination_simulation

Document introduction

There are four files in this folder, three are R script files and one is background data file of recombination rate information. Three R language scripts are “F1-DH-125k.R”, “MAGIC-8parent-125k.R” and “MAGIC-8parent-125k-DH.R”. A recombination rate background file is “map_data.txt”. The “F1-DH-125k.R” script file is to run to generate the result of simulating the genotype of 200 materials for F1-DH population. The script file of “MAGIC-8parent-125k.R” is to run to generate the result of genotyping 200 lines from 8 parents. The script file of “MAGIC-8parent-125k-DH.R” is to run to generate the result of genotype simulation of eight parental DH induced MAGIC population.
